Learning to use the game engine Godot. 


This repo includes my attempts at making some Godot games. Additionally some projects that encapsulate a particular/singular concept are included.

When I began working on this project Godot 2 was most recently released. Projects BreakInvaders, MultiScene, and gameWorld1 are all written for Godot 2.

Since learning Godot, Godot 3 has been released. Projects written for Godot 2 will not work correctly in Godot 3.

Future projects will be written using Godot 3.
